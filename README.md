ITMService
==========

This repo is made up of code from a test project. The project was an iPhone application that posted videos, images and text as 
form data to a web service. The web service is what you see here. This is not production ready and was used only for a 
prototype demonstration. The web service uses the .NET Web Api framework to allow uploads and to do some basic authentication 
of users of the web api.
